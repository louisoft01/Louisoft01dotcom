<p>Meet desubot a very buggy very annoying discord bot made in c#. She does not have a tidy code base and was written to try and get me to learn c#. She has a meme sort of tone and likes to break at random times. You have been warned. However if you want to try this discord bot your are perfectly welcome to.</p>
<p>I may also want to state that Desu Bot is provided as is and with no warranty. Uptime is not 100% due to bugs and other problems too.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:center" class="text-danger">Desu bot is now offline, thanks to anyone that put up with her.</h1>
<h1>Source Code</h1>
<p>Desu Bots source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/louisoft01/desu_bot">here</a>.</p>
